This is a repository with the data for the MRL 2022 shared-task &mdash; clause-level morphology.

Every folder corresponds to a sub-task: inflection, reinflection and analysis.

The test sets will be released in a covered format (exemplified for the dev set).
Participants will be required to complete the prediction for each line separated by a `\t`.

See the [shared-task's website](https://sigtyp.github.io/st2022-mrl.html) for more details.
